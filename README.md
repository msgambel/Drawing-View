Drawing-View
============

An easy to add Drawing View that allows users to draw!

Works on any iOS device, 5.0 and up!

Simply add the **Drawing View** folder to you app, and you gain the ability to draw! Drag a UIView into any nib or storyboard and change the class name to **DrawView**, and the DrawView class takes care of the rest! When a user taps on the DrawView, it will expand to full screen to allow for wonderful works of art!

The DrawView allows you to draw in multiple colours, undo/redo lines, clear the image, and of course, use an eraser!

The DrawView class is heavily commented, so any modifications you want to make should be easy to add!

Currently, the DrawView class only supports **portrait** orientation, but landscape is on the way!

**Note:** This has not been tested with **Auto-Layout**, so there may be issues not yet found. If any bugs are found, please email me at: michaelsgam10@hotmail.com.
